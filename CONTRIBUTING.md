# How to contribute

Bug reports and feature requests can be submitted via Github Issues in this repo.

We recommend proposing new features as Issues before implementing them, to ensure they’re
compatible with other planned or in-progress improvements.


## Submitting Changes

Pull requests must be approved by someone listed in [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) before being merged to main.
PRs will be reviewed on a best-effort basis.

Pull request descriptions should follow the outline in our PR template, including
a description of the change and how it has been tested. The code changes should also
pass our [pre-submit checks](./.pre-commit-config.yaml).


## Testing

Please add unit tests for any new features you add, and make sure that all existing tests are passing.


## Contact

For other questions or requests, please reach out to `opensource@rewiringamerica.org`.
